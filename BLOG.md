# Uniforge, Why It Matters

Simplicity is at the core of what we do. Uniforge is set to become the standard for deployin and minting NFTs.

Uniforge is revolutionary in that it closes the gap between the creators looking for someone to code their NFT collection smartcontract, and the possibilities that blockchain enables to them.

## We heard you, some of us were in your situation before.

It takes time and effort to learn how to develop your smartcontracts in a secure way or find a developer you can trust and agree with your vision and objectives.
It is tiresome to find platforms with long funnels that ask you to provide personal information and credit card data with no guarantees.
Is not in the ethos of descentralization to create your collection in thirdparties' smartcontracts as your collection will be forever embedded in other's collection.
It is confusing to deploy a collection where the code is hard to understand and you dont know what you are buying.

Adittionally, as veterans in this industry, we feel the responsability to improve the security in the space. Protecting the next waves of web3 users from vulnerable exploitable smartcontracts or phising mints. A standard guardrails for embarking new users, creators and collectors is very much needed.

## The solution.

Uniforge was created to fix all these issues and make the web3 users life better. All our focus is directed in the deployment and mint process, providing creators a powerful tool to quickly materialize their vision. After that, creators and communities can make use of their assets in the way they please, whether it is governance tools such as Snapshot, secondary marketplaces such as Opensea, skating protocols and much more.

## How does it work?

(conclusion)
It is a no-coding, permissionless, multichain, gas-efficient platform
Uniforge allow creators to craft and deploy their own fully customizable smartcontract with no-coding. only create collection's in 3rd parties smartcontracts. They actually become the deployers and the crafters of their own smart contract.

We launch offering the standard implementation of the NFT standard ERC721, most probably we will expand in the future offering mre flexibility to creators.

## Solving the builder's trilema

In any project one needs to choose two among speed, quality and cost. We want to converge the three of them into a single high quality product where you can benefit instantly with a reasonable price.
