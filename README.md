# Welcome to Uniforge

Uniforge is a decentralized platform developed by Dapponics, that allows artists, creators and entrepreneurs to deploy and manage their own NFT collections without requiring any technical knowledge or expertise and enables others to mint the NFTs from the collections inside the platform. 

With Uniforge, users can create, manage, showcase, and mint their unique digital assets without any intermediaries, making it fully decentralized.

## Features
-   **Collection Deployment**: Easily deploy your own NFT collection and **customize** its properties, such as name, symbol, mint price starting date and total supply.
-   **Collection Manager**: Safely manage your deployed NFT collection, editing properties such as mint fee, modifying the ownership or withdrawing the funds from the sale.
-   **Minting**: Allow others to mint their own NFTs from your collection, which they can use to represent their unique digital identity or participation in your project.
-   **IPFS Storage**: Additionally we offer a Storage Service to store your NFT files such as images and metadata securely and in a decentralized manner on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).
-   **Fully Decentralized**: Uniforge is built on blockchain technology, meaning that it is decentralized, secure, and transparent.

## Pricing
-   **Deployment service**: The price for deployment consist on a fixed price plus the gas fees (our contracts are gas optimized but bear in mind that deploying a NFT collection is a gas intensive operation in the blockchain). The fixed price value is adjusted to meet market conditions.

-   **Storage service**: The price for the storage service is a periodic payment on a monthly or yearly basis to cover the expenses of keeping the files pinned on IPFS. Besides offering this service we always encourage users to pin their own collections on IPFS to increase descentralization.

Beside the above services, Uniforge does not collect any other financial resource from your actions in the platform and **you keep 100% of your NFT sale profits**, also **you appear on chain as the deployer** and you or the chosen owner of the collection has **total ownership of the smartcontract** of your own collection and you can interact with it freely  on the Manage section from our app or externally on etherscan or your own frontend.

## About
At Dapponics, we believe in the power of decentralization and importance of protecting users privacy and security and their rights to fully own the assets. That's why we've designed our platform to be fully decentralized, with no central authority controlling the platform.
