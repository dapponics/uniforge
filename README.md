# Welcome to Uniforge

[Uniforge](https://uniforge.io/) is a decentralized permissionless multichain platform developed by Dapponics, that allows creators to easily deploy, manage and showcase their own NFT collections, and collectors to explore and mint the NFTs from the collections in a secure and reliable way.

With Uniforge, creators can finally become the deployers of their brand new smart contract with zero technical knowledge and collectors can create onchain unique digital assets safely without any intermediaries, making it fully accessible and fair.

## Features

- **Collection Deployment**: Easily deploy your own unique NFT collection and customize its properties, such as name, symbol, mint price, total supply and starting date of the public sale.
- **Collection Management**: Safely manage your deployed NFT collection, editing properties such as mint price, modifying the ownership or withdrawing the funds from the sale.
- **Minting**: Allow others to mint their own NFTs from your collection, which they can use to represent their unique asset or share from your project.
- **IPFS Storage**: Additionally we offer a Storage Service to store your NFT files such as images and metadata securely and in a decentralized manner on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).
- **Fully Decentralized**: Uniforge is built on blockchain technology, meaning that it is decentralized, secure, and transparent.

## Pricing

- **Deployment service**: The price for deployment consists of a fixed price plus the gas fees. While our contracts are gas-optimized, it's worth noting that deploying an NFT collection is a gas-intensive operation on the blockchain. The fixed price value is adjusted to meet market conditions.

- **Storage service**: The price for the storage service is a periodic payment on a monthly or yearly basis to cover the expenses of keeping the files pinned on IPFS. Even though we offer this service, we always encourage users to pin their own collections on IPFS to increase decentralization.

Besides the above-mentioned services, Uniforge does not collect any other financial resources from your actions on the platform, and you keep 100% of your NFT sale profits. Additionally, you appear on-chain as the deployer of the NFT collection's smart contract, and this contract is entirely owned by you (or the address you choose to become the owner). You are able to interact with your smart contract freely through the Uniforge app or externally with a different frontend.

## About

At Dapponics, we believe in the power of decentralization. We also believe in the importance of protecting users' privacy and security and preserving their rights to fully own their assets. That's why we've designed our platform to be fully decentralized, with no central authority controlling the platform.
