# Welcome to Uniforge

Uniforge is a decentralized platform developed by Dapponics, that allows artists, creators and entrepreneurs to deploy and manage their own NFT collections without requiring any technical knowledge or expertise and enables others to mint the NFTs from the collections inside the platform. 

With Uniforge, users can create, manage, showcase, and mint their unique digital assets without any intermediaries, making it fully decentralized.

## Features

-   **Collection Deployment**: Easily deploy your own NFT collection and customize its properties, such as name, symbol, and total supply.
-   **Collection Manager**: Safely manage your deployed NFT collection, editing properties such as mint fee, modifying the ownership or withdrawing the funds.
-   **Minting**: Allow others to mint their own NFTs from your collection, which they can use to represent their unique digital identity or participation in your project.
-   **IPFS Storage**: Additionally we offer a Storage Service to store your NFT files such as images and metadata securely and in a decentralized manner on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).
-   **Fully Decentralized**: Uniforge is built on blockchain technology, meaning that it is decentralized, secure, and transparent.

## Pricing
-   **Deployment**: The price for deployment consist on a fixed price plus the gas fees from the blockchain (our contracts are gas optimized but deploying a NFT collection is a gas intensive operation in the blockchain). The fixed price value is adjusted to meet market conditions.

-   **Storage**: The price for the storage service is a periodic payment on a monthly or yearly basis to cover the expenses of keeping the files pinned on IPFS. Besides offering this service we always encourage users to pin their own collections on IPFS to increase descentralization.




At Dapponics, we believe in the power of decentralization and importance of protecting users privacy and security and their rights to fully own the assets. That's why we've designed our platform to be fully decentralized, with no central authority controlling the platform.
