# Welcome to Uniforge

[Uniforge](https://uniforge.io/) is a decentralized permissionless multichain platform developed by Dapponics, that allows creators to easily deploy, manage and showcase their own NFT collections, and collectors to explore and mint the NFTs from the collections in a secure and reliable way.

With Uniforge, creators can finally become the deployers of their brand new smart contract with zero technical knowledge and collectors can create onchain unique digital assets safely without any intermediaries, making it fully accessible and fair.

The smart contracts for the NFT collections are made to be universal, robust and immutable. Uniforge's goal is to set the standards for quality and descentralization, without centralized features to serve impermanent platforms or dangerously upgradeable proxies to alter logic at will.

## Features

- **Deploy**: Easily deploy your own unique NFT collection and customize its properties, such as name, symbol, mint price or total supply, and become the deployer of your own smart contract.
- **Manage**: Safely manage your deployed NFT collection, editing properties such as mint price, modifying the ownership or withdrawing the funds from the public sale.
- **Storage**: Store your NFT files such as images and metadata securely and in a decentralized manner on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).
- **Gallery**: Showcase your collections in the homepage public gallery, where collectors can find your displayed NFTs and go to your mint page.
- **Mint Page**: Allow collectors to mint their own NFTs from your collection once the public sale starts in a unique page created exclusively for you.

## Pricing

- **Deployment service**: The price for deployment consists of a fixed price plus the gas fees. While our contracts are gas-optimized, it's worth noting that deploying an NFT collection is a gas-intensive operation on the blockchain. The fixed price value is adjusted to meet market conditions. Manage, Gallery and Mint Page are infinite-access free features for the creators who deploy a collection.

- **Storage service**: The price for the storage service is a periodic payment on a monthly or yearly basis to cover the expenses of keeping the files pinned on IPFS. Even though we offer this service, we always encourage users to pin their own collections on IPFS to increase decentralization.

Besides Deployment and Storage services, Uniforge does not collect any other financial resources from your actions on the platform. Uniforge gets 0% of your NFT sale profits and 0% of your future royalties.
